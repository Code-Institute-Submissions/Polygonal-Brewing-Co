# POLYGONAL BREWING CO. WEBSITE

## DESCRIPTION

This is the front-facing website of a hypothetical craft brewery. Its purpose is to invite visitors to its facilities while highlighting its products and elevating its brand.
It is divided in 4 pages:

- Home: introduces the brewery and gives information about access
- Beers: showcases the brewery’s products in an attractive way
- Brewery: explains the company’s ethos and values
- Visit: a form for users to plan a visit and get in touch

## DEPLOYMENT AND LIVE DEMO

The site has been deployed to github and is accessible on [github pages](https://jumboduck.github.io/Polygonal-Brewing-Co/).

## WIREFRAME

A detailed wire framing process was undertaken to oversee the structure of the site and ensure proper organization of content on desktop and mobile versions of the site.

The final version of the wireframe can be found [here](https://jumboduck.github.io/Polygonal-Brewing-Co/assets/wireframes/Polygonal-Brewing-Wireframe.pdf).

## UX

![alt text](https://jumboduck.github.io/Polygonal-Brewing-Co/assets/wireframes/devices-display.png "Polygonal Brewing Co. logo")

The site was built for a comfortable intuitive experience across all devices, while maintaining brand authenticity.

Bold colors are used in the header and footer, in line with the company’s brand and to provide anchors to structure the page, while the body uses a cleaner design for legibility.

The website adapts its layout and content based on screen-size for ease of use. The beers page, for example, will turn the list of products into a swipe-able carousel on mobile devices, to provide an enjoyable intuitive experience and prevent excessive scrolling.

Throughout the site, the navigation stays at the top of the display for ease of navigation, and again, as a reminder of the visual identity of the brewery.

## FEATURES

The site uses various features from bootstrap:

- Image carousels to give users an overview of what to expect on location.
- Sticky navigation, collapsable on mobile.
- Modal windows on [Beers](https://jumboduck.github.io/Polygonal-Brewing-Co/beers.html) page to display information about products.
- Progress bars in said modal windows to display caracteristics of product.
- On mobile devices the [Beers](https://jumboduck.github.io/Polygonal-Brewing-Co/beers.html) page changes to a carousel, displaying the content in a more user-friendly fashion. Users can swipe left and right to navigate the information.
- Flexbox classes used to keep footer at the bottom of the page, regardless of content size.

## TESTING

The site was tested on various platforms to ensure proper display across different screen sizes.

Form validation was tested on both the [Visit](https://jumboduck.github.io/Polygonal-Brewing-Co/visit.html) page and the footer form.

## SCALABILITY

Adding an online shop functionality for product or merchandise would be an added benefit to the site and the general branding strategy of the company.

As the [beer listing](https://jumboduck.github.io/Polygonal-Brewing-Co/beers.html) expands a sorting and search system with pagination should be implemented to facilitate access to content and prevent information overload.
